    Welcome to Zwapp, a concept-app (prototype) that showcases my abilities as a UI/UX developer! 

    <p>Zwapp also serves as an example of an app using PHP and MongoDB. This app illustrates possible use cases for easily finding a particular comic book issue, for example to be entered into a comic book collection. </p>
    
    <p>Zwapp also demonstrates a "mobile-first" application in which the workflows can be intuitively followed using a single finger on a touch screen, while providing good responsiveness for use with a desktop browser.</p>
    <p>The focus of this app is to demonstrate user interaction and app front-end design, so some of the theoretical workflows only go so far, enough to demonstrate the UI. </p>
    
    <p>With that in mind, please enjoy!</p>

   Welcome to Zwapp! While not intended for "real world" use, Zwapp is meant to be a conceptual app that showcases my abilities as a UI/UX developer. It also serves as my first project using PHP and MongoDB. This app illustrates possible use cases for easily finding a particular comicbook issue, for example to entered into a comicbook collection. Zwapp is also intended as a "mobile-first" application in which the workflows can be intuitively followed using a single finger on a touch screen, while providing good responsiveness for use with a desktop browser.

    <p>Because the focus of this app is on user interaction and app front-end design, many of the theoretical workflows will only go so far as to demonstrate the UI. With that in mind, please enjoy!</p> #}

{% set bio %}
    Hello! I'm Josh Eisenthal, an experienced front-end software developer with a passion for user interaction (UX). I've also had a life-long love for comic books and the world of super heroes! I spent the early yers of my career developing an expertise in building desktop applications using Java Swing. About 5 years ago, I transitioned to front-end work for single page web apps, first using the Backbone framework, then moving on to React. A lot of my recent work has focused on the implementation of UX concepts and designs, developing large sets of CSS on top of a UX reference implementation of the final product. Currently I'm tackling exciting freelance projects that focus on the front-end. I am based in the Greater Boston area (MA, U.S.).
